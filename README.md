# ToDoList Program

## Description

ToDoList is a command line to-do list application written in Java. It allows users to enter tasks that they need to keep track of and complete later on. Users can view all tasks that they have put into the program, they can isolate the unifinished tasks to just view those, and they can mark tasks as complete. When the to-do list is closed, unfinished tasks are stored into a CSV file that is read upon reopening the program.

The program is fully written in Java and takes advantage of file creating, file reading, file writing, and file closing from Java.io libraries to save and manipulate data in the CSV file that comes with the program.
