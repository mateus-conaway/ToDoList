# ToDoList Program

## Description

ToDoList is a command line to-do list application written in Java. It allows users to enter tasks that they need to keep track of and complete later on. Users can view all tasks that they have put into the program, they can isolate the unifinished tasks to just view those, and they can mark tasks as complete. When the to-do list is closed, unfinished tasks are stored into a CSV file that is read upon reopening the program.

The program is fully written in Java and takes advantage of file creating, file reading, file writing, and file closing from Java.io libraries to save and manipulate data in the CSV file that comes with the program.

## How to Install/Use the Project
**Installation**

Simply download the ZIP file from this repository and unzip it into a path of your choosing! Make sure to have Java installed on your computer.

**Setting up the project**

Use your OS terminal to locate the path where the project is saved and head into the src folder. Use the javac command to compile Task.java, ToDoList.java, and Main.java. User will only have to do this once.

***-javac Task.java*** 

***-javac ToDoList.java*** 

***-javac Main.java***

**Running the program**

Run the program by typing ***java Main*** in the terminal while located in the src folder. To use the program again, navigate to the src folder of this project and type this command. __This is how you will run the program everytime after compiling the three java files.__

**Using the program**

Once the program is started, enter the number associated with the command next to each command prompt. Follow the instructions following once you enter the command.

**Next Steps of Development**

The next step for me is to create a graphical user interface to complement this project. This will allow for a cleaner look and easier readability for the user. The user will be able to click a button to type in a task description, and a task list will be visible from the start of the program with a checkbox next to it for easier management of completing tasks. This may also be paired with an SQL database.
